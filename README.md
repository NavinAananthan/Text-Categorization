# Sentence Categorization and Visualization

Welcome to our innovative Sentence Categorization and Visualization project! This application allows users to categorize sentences uploaded via a CSV file using two methodologies: a text classification model and the Top2Vec algorithm. The categorized results are then presented through an intuitive bar graph for easy interpretation.

## Features

- **Methodologies:**
  - Text Classification Model
  - Top2Vec Categorization

- **Upload CSV:**
  - Seamless CSV file upload for efficient processing.

- **Automated Categorization:**
  - Choose between the text classification model or Top2Vec algorithm for categorizing sentences.

- **Visualization:**
  - Dynamic bar graph reflecting the distribution of categories/topics.

## Models Used
   - Text Classification Model : dima806/news-category-classifier-distilbert

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Categories

 - The sentences are categorized into the following topics for Text Classification Model:

    - **Arts**
    - **Health**
    - **Entertainment**
    - **Home**
    - **Style**
    - **Environment**
    - **Business**
    - **Positive News**
    - **Politics**
    - **War**
    - **Travel**
    - **Food**
    - **Academics**
    - **Technology**
    - **Negative News**
    - **World News**
    - **Sports**
    - **Religion**
    - **Crime**
      
- The sentences are categorized into the following topics for Top2Vec:

### Usage

1. Choose Methodology:
   - Select either the Text Classification Model or Top2Vec Categorization.

2. Upload CSV:
   - Use the app interface to upload your CSV file containing sentences.

3. View Results:
   - Explore the dynamically generated bar graph representing the distribution of categories/topics.

## Methodology Details

### Text Classification Model

- **Precision and Accuracy:**
  - High precision and accuracy in categorizing sentences.
- **Training Flexibility:**
  - Option to train the model on specific categories or topics.
- **Real-time Classification:**
  - Real-time insights as sentences are processed.

### Top2Vec Categorization

- **Embedding-based Approach:**
  - Unsupervised topic modeling capturing semantic relationships.
- **Dynamic Clustering:**
  - Automatic clustering into topics without predefined categories.
- **Contextual Understanding:**
  - Considers contextual meaning for nuanced categorization.

## Advantages

- Methodological Diversity: Two powerful approaches provide flexibility.
- Adaptability: Top2Vec excels in adapting to various datasets without predefined categories.
- Interpretability: Visualize the distribution of topics for easy comprehension.

## Future Directions

- Ensemble Methods: Explore combining the strengths of both methodologies.
- User Feedback Integration: Continuously improve the system with user feedback.
